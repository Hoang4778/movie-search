# Movie Search

## Description

This project comes from my orginal idea of making a trivial website like IMdb since I love watching movies. In this project, I mainly used VueJS as a scalfolding tool for building SPAs. The theme, color and font bring the classics to the page but also give users refreshment due to new contents update very often.
**Note: This webpage is just a demo and for desktop only**

## Functionalities of this site

1. Users can choose to view latest movies and TV shows on the homepage and detail pages
2. The site allows searching based on names, keywords, genres.

## What I learned

- It was so good when I first learned VueJS and implement it into my project because it provides boilerplate setup which helped me manage the source code.
By building this project, I learned lots of core features of VueJS such as directives, conditional rendering, routing, components, data flows.etc. It is when I decide to use VueJS for most of my projects.
- Not only I got to make the website work but I had to make it good-looking. Therefore, I learned to make a carousel from scratch, an accordion and page layout based on my experience with replicating templates.
- It was a great time for me to learn how to fetch API from a third-party site that limits API call to 100 times per day. It was frustrating at first due to lots of materials in retrieval data and I did not keep track of how many API call I made during a day. To get around that, I got to design the page first and when I could fetch data again, I just needed to worry about the logic of the page.
